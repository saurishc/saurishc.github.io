# Post Doctoral Experience
As a postdoctoral fellow, I started my journey at the [Indian Institute of Science](http://www.physics.iisc.ac.in/). There, I worked in Chandan Dasgupta's group. From there, I moved to the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://icts.res.in/). In ICTS, I worked with Subhro Bhattacharjee and Abhishek Dhar. My final days as a postdoc were spent at the [Nanyang Technological University](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/r.ni/) is Ran Ni's group. During this entire time, I worked on problems in statistical physics and condensed matter physics.
